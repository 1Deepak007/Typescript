Typescript provides type safety.
TypeScript is a syntactic superset of JavaScript which adds static typing.
This basically means that TypeScript adds syntax on top of JavaScript, allowing developers to add types.
TypeScript is a statically typed language, which means that the type checking is done at compile time, not at runtime. This makes it easier to catch type-related errors early in the development process.
